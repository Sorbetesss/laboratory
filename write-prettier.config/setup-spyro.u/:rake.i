+Before merging a new workflow, the following requirements need to be met:
 
 - Should be as simple as is needed for the service.
 - There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now we don't have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages might not be accepted.

+# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
+# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when a release is created
+#
+# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
+#
+# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
+#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
+#    Replace the value of `ECR_REPOSITORY` in the workflow below with your repository's name.
+#    Replace the value of `aws-region` in the workflow below with your repository's region.
+#
+# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
+#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
+#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
+#    Replace the values for `service` and `cluster` in the workflow below with your service and cluster names.
+#
+# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
+#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
+#    Replace the value of `task-definition` in the workflow below with your JSON file's name.
+#    Replace the value of `container-name` in the workflow below with the name of the container
+#    in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.
+#
+# 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
+#    See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user,
+#    and best practices on handling the access key credentials.

PPD: Used for a one-time or recurring business to consumer ACH transaction, for which you have written authorization—Meaning a signed form or contract.

TEL: Used for a one-time or recurring business to consumer ACH transaction that was authorized over the telephone.

WEB: Used for a one-time or recurring business to consumer ACH transaction that was authorized by submitting a form over the Internet.

CCD: Used for a one-time or recurring business to business ACH transaction, for which you have written (mail, email, or fax) or telephone authorization in addition to having a general written agreement with the company for ACH debits to its account.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing When filing tax documents, ING payments, or replying to any related correspondence, it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing When filing tax documents, ING payments, or replying to any related correspondence, it is very important that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above.

The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators.

+Before merging a new workflow, the following requirements need to be met:
 
 - Should be as simple as is needed for the service.
 - There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now we don't have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages might not be accepted.

+# This workflow will build and push a new container image to Amazon ECR,
+# and then will deploy a new task definition to Amazon ECS, when a release is created
+#
+# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
+#
+# 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.
+#    For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`.
+#    Replace the value of `ECR_REPOSITORY` in the workflow below with your repository's name.
+#    Replace the value of `aws-region` in the workflow below with your repository's region.
+#
+# 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.
+#    For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console:
+#      https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun
+#    Replace the values for `service` and `cluster` in the workflow below with your service and cluster names.
+#
+# 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.
+#    The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`.
+#    Replace the value of `task-definition` in the workflow below with your JSON file's name.
